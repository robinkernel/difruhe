# Difruhe v0.2

Difruhe is not a tool.  
Difruhe is not a platform.  

Difruhe is a structural language — a language of irreversible, referenceable difference.

Spec is open.  
Implementations are free to choose.  
Verification MUST be offline-capable and deterministic.

## Versioning

- Latest language: v0.2  
- Historical releases remain valid and referenceable.  
- No future amendment may silently alter prior normative semantics.

## Identity Scope (Language Only)

Difruhe language identity is computed from spec semantics only:

1. DIFRUHE_CONSTITUTION_v0.2.md  
2. EVENT_VOCAB_v0.2.md  
3. REFERENCE_CANON_v0.2.md  
4. RULE_CANON_v0.2.md  

Non-normative repository files (README, release notes, tools, manifests) do not affect language identity.
