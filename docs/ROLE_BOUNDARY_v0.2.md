Forbidden:
- defining Difruhe semantics (no legislation)
- defining asset value / CFU pricing / market rules
- multi-AI collaboration policy

## Virigo (L3) — Orchestration / Production Interface
Input:
- window recap, candidates, refs/fingerprints only
Output:

## FailBank (L4) — Asset Engine / Diagnostics / Distribution
