# Difruhe Constitution v0.2

## I. Foundational Axioms (Difference Layer)

1) Differences are append-only.
2) Differences must be referenceable.

These axioms are absolute and non-derogable.

---

## II. Structural Laws (Mutual Recognition Layer)

1) Append-Only Time  
   Structural history cannot be rewritten.

2) Event-Driven State  
   State exists only as the result of declared differences.

3) Canonical Identity  
   Structural continuity must be verifiable via reference and rule_fingerprint.

4) Verifiable Evidence Binding  
   No structural DONE state is valid without evidence binding.

5) Shared Cadence for Verdict  
   PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED are structural states, not opinions.

---

## III. Non-Normative Notes

Difruhe defines structure, not execution.

Implementation is sovereign.

Execution environments, coordination models, actor roles,
tooling, runtime behavior, and governance mechanisms
are outside the normative scope of this Constitution.
