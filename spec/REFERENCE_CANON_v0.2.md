# Reference Canon v0.2

A structural difference is valid only if referenceable.

A reference MUST be:

- Resolvable
- Verifiable
- Non-drifting

If required references cannot be verified,
a structural DONE state MUST NOT be asserted.

Reference validity is a structural requirement,
not an implementation preference.
