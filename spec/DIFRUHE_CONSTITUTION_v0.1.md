## Two Foundational Axioms (Difference Layer)
1) Differences are append-only.
2) Differences must be referenceable.

## Five Structural Laws (Mutual Recognition Layer)
1) Append-Only Time
2) Event-Driven State
3) Canonical Identity (no forks)
4) Verifiable Evidence Binding (no hard evidence, no done)
5) Shared Cadence for Verdict (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED are structural)

## Coordination Model (Multi-Actor)
Actors declare authority_role (Producer/Validator/Committer/Adjudicator) and scope_class (Local/Structural/Final).
